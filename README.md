# Face Mask Detection

This project aims to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using computer vision and machine learning techniques. It utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to classify images or video frames into two classes: "with mask" and "without mask".

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of wearing face masks as a preventive measure against the spread of the virus. Face mask detection systems can help ensure compliance with mask-wearing guidelines in public spaces such as hospitals, airports, and shopping malls. This project provides a solution for automating face mask detection using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- Detect whether a person is wearing a face mask in images or video streams.
- Provide real-time feedback on mask-wearing compliance.
- Utilize a pre-trained deep learning model for image classification.
- Offer flexibility for integration with surveillance systems or access control systems.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for deep learning models)
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://https://github.com/svprferg/Face-Mask-Detection
cd face-mask-detection

2.Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the pre-trained model (if required):

Depending on the chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch), download the pre-trained model and place it in the appropriate directory within the project.

4.Run the face mask detection script:
python detect_mask.py

5.Follow the on-screen instructions to test the face mask detection system.
